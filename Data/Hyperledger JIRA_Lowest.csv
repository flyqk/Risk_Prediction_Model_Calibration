",,,,,,,,,,,0|i00dvj:,,,mastersingh24,zuowang,,,,,,,,,"06/Aug/16 2:04 PM;mastersingh24;This is actually working as designed.  When you use the REST API to login, what happens is that whichever peer's REST endpoint you are using enrolls with membership services on your behalf (which basically means it registers and downloads all of your enrollment material).  The enrollSecret used for login is actually a one-time password so once you login / enroll one time, you will no longer be able to use that enrollSecret again.

When you logout using the REST API, essentially all that is happening is that your enrollment material is being deleted from that peer (so it is not really a logout in the classic sense).

This stems from the original thought that people would use NVPs as local ""virtual wallets"" to connect to remote fabric nodes.  But the reality is that this is not the strategy going forward and that is what led to the NodeJS SDK which actually does enroll and download your material from mebership services and will allow you to communicate with all peers using that ID not just a single peer like the REST API.",,,,,,
Failed registration leaves the internal data structure in an inconsistent state,FAB-68,12367,Bug,Done,FAB,Fabric,software,ChristopherFerris,,,Lowest,Done,agaragiola,smithbk,smithbk,8/12/2016 22:11,4/2/2017 12:21,4/26/2018 6:50,4/2/2017 12:21,v0.6,WON'T FIX,,fabric-membersrvc,,0,MembershipServices,,,See https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/fabric/issues/2183,,,,,,,,,,,0|i00e3f:,,,ChristopherFerris,mastersingh24,smithbk,,,,,,,,"05/Sep/16 8:58 PM;ChristopherFerris;Description

When a registration fails the internal data structure are left in an inconsistent state at the client and at the membership service side. For instance, trying to register the second time with the same credentials will succeed by saying that the node has been already registered.

Describe How to Reproduce

The following test try to register a client with an enrollID that correspond to a validator at the membership service. The first call fails as expected but second doesn't. The client is in an inconsistent state.

func TestDoubleRegistrationWithDifferentRoles(t * testing.T) {
    err := RegisterClient(""validator"", nil, ""validator"", ""9gvZQRwhUq9q"")
    if err == nil {
        t.Fatal(""Init should fail"")
    }

    err = RegisterClient(""validator"", nil, ""validator"", ""9gvZQRwhUq9q"")
    if err == nil {
        t.Fatal(""Init should fail"")
    }
}
The following test try to register a client with an enrollID that correspond to a validator at the membership service. The first call fails as expected but second should succeed. The membership service is in an inconsistent state.

func TestDoubleRegistration(t * testing.T) {
    // Wrong type
    err := RegisterClient(""validator"", nil, ""validator"", ""9gvZQRwhUq9q"")
    if err == nil {
        t.Fatalf(""RegisterValidator should fail"")
    }

    // Right type
    err = RegisterValidator(""validator"", nil, ""validator"", ""9gvZQRwhUq9q"")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf(""RegisterValidator should succed [%s]"", err)
    }
}
Actually, the above test is really subtle because the failure of the first RegisterClient happens at very end of the protocol when the RegisterClient parses the latest message sent by the MS. So, from the MS point of view, the protocol has been successfully run. One solution would be then to modify to registration protocol to notify immediately the MS about which kind of registration the client is trying to do. Other solutions are possible. @JonathanLevi what do you think?",02/Apr/17 12:21 PM;mastersingh24;There is no longer active development on v0.6 so closing this,,,,,

h1. Discussion:

About the 0 balance issue @jranz303 found, it seems to be a base64 encoding/decoding issue. When I try to initialize with a zero balance, for example: `{""partyA"":{""entity"":""a"", ""value"":100}, ""partyB"":{""entity"":""b"", ""value"":0}}`, the base64 encoded args are: `CgUKAWEQZBIDCgFi` When I decode that, I get something like:

```

ad
b
```

The d corresponds to ASCII value 100, which seems like an odd way to encode it but that’s what appears to be happening. ASCII 0 is NULL, so I think what’s happening is on decoding, ByteBuffer is hitting this line for account b’s amount:

```
if (buffer === null || typeof buffer !== 'object')
            throw TypeError(""Illegal buffer”);
```

---

interesting
what should be happening is a clean pipeline from protobuf->binary->base64 and back out again
my guess is protobuf elided the entire message structure when the value of zero was presented
what was the base64 in the case of 0?

---

I’m not exactly sure.
Args: `{""partyA"":{""entity"":""a"", ""value"":100}}`
Base64: `CgUKAWEQZA==`

Args: `{""partyA"":{""entity"":""a"", ""value"":0}}`
Base64: `CgMKAWE=`

---

my guess is whats happening here is something along the lines of `protobuf.encode(BalanceResult{0]).len == 0` and `base64(null) -> decode64` breaks somewhere
