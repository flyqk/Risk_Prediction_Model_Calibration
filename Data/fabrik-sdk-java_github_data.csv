https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6797/

Last big change rearranging for the moving from .6 to 1.0.
 (most churn is because of this- not new code)
Members services entirely moved to new package org.hyperledger.fabric_ca
SDK itself is not involved with registering or enrollment -
  left to the embedding application and FCAClient.
All persistence is left for the embedding application.
GOPATH environment is not used for GO code.
  The embedding application is free to implement this.
Finally users can be registered with an Admin user through FCAClient .

--------------------------------------
PS 19: Don't need separate package for Sample store move to sdkintegration test package
PS 22: Fix for changes in enrollment and registration.
PS 23: Move Fabric CA based exception to fabric_ca
PS 24: RegistrationException wrong base class.
PS 25: More consistent names move FCA ->HFCA
PS 26: Addressed Tuan's comments.
PS 27: Rebase
PS 28: Rebase
